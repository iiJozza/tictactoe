## Features

### Gameboard

- User is presented with a gameboard.
- Hovering over the board makes the cursor change to a pointer.
- Clicking a cell makes an X or O appear, depending on whose turn it is.
- If someone has won or the game is drawn, no more marks can be put on the board.

### Interactive Buttons

Below the gameboard, there are two buttons:

- The button on the left, named "Restart," clears all the symbols on the gameboard.
- The button on the right, named "Info," redirects the user to the home page where they can review the rules or learn how to interact with the site.

### Scoreboard

- When either the player using the X's or O's wins, their score increases on the scoreboard below.
- This feature allows users to keep track of who has won if played multiple times.

### Winning Message

- When a match concludes with a tie or when someone has won, a message pops up underneath the gameboard, declaring the winner or indicating if it's a draw.

## Features Left to Implement

There are several features I plan to implement in the future:

- Make the winning screen and restart button be connected to a pop-up window that shows up when a game is concluded.
- Style both the home-page and the game-page to make them more appealing.
- Make the game more suitable to play on larger screens.
- Implement a feature where the person who went second last round gets to go first the next round.

- **JavaScript:** The game play logic was created using JavaScript in an external file.
- **Code Anywhere:** The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding the project.
- **GitHub:** Source code is hosted on GitHub and deployed using GitHub Pages.
- **Git:** Used for version control, allowing for commits and code pushes during development.
- **Font Awesome:** Icons obtained from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) were used for the favicon.
- **Favicon.io:** Favicon files were created at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).

## Testing 

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Codeanywhere editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘Portfolio-Project-2-Poker-Fun’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add .``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the menu on left select 'Pages'
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
  - Click 'Save'
  - A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully.
