        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>
          Each player is designated with a specific mark, either O or X, which
          you take turn to place on the board. the goal of the game is to try to
          match three of your own marks in either horizontal, vertical or
          diagonal direction within the board. The first one to achieve this
          wins!
          <br />
          But remember that there is only 9 cells to place your mark so be
          careful where you put your mark or your opponent might either block
          your win or win themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>To start the game</h3>
        <p>
          In order to start the game you have to press the start button below.
          This will send you to a grid and you can start playing!
        </p>
        <h3>To restart the game</h3>
        <p>
          When the game is either won, lost or ended in a draw you can click the
          restart button below the board in order to play again. This won't take
          away your points, only the placed marks!
          <br/>
          Now it is time to jump in and play. Good luck!
