## Features

### Gameboard

- User is presented with a gameboard.
- Hovering over the board makes the cursor change to a pointer.
- Clicking a cell makes an X or O appear, depending on whose turn it is.
- If someone has won or the game is drawn, no more marks can be put on the board.

### Interactive Buttons

Below the gameboard, there are two buttons:

- The button on the left, named "Restart," clears all the symbols on the gameboard.
- The button on the right, named "Info," redirects the user to the home page where they can review the rules or learn how to interact with the site.

### Scoreboard

- When either the player using the X's or O's wins, their score increases on the scoreboard below.
- This feature allows users to keep track of who has won if played multiple times.

### Winning Message

- When a match concludes with a tie or when someone has won, a message pops up underneath the gameboard, declaring the winner or indicating if it's a draw.

## Features Left to Implement

There are several features you plan to implement in the future:

- Make the winning screen and restart button be connected to a pop-up window that shows up when a game is concluded.
- Style both the home page and the game page to make them more appealing.
- Make the game more suitable to play on larger screens.
- Implement a feature where the person who went second last round gets to go first the next round.
